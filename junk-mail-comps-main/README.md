# Overview

This app was developed for the Office of Health Promotion Junk Mail program at Carleton College. This app is designed specifically for Carleton college students and the Student Wellness Advocates who run the program and fill orders. It was developed to replace the current Google Form ordering system for menstrual/safe-sex supplies. The app allows all Carleton students to create an account with their school email and then log in to order these supplies.

### Tech Stack

Our app is written in React Native to allow users to access on both iOS/Android without having to write separate codebases. Firebase Authentication was used to create and store user accounts and Firestore database stores and tracks all orders.

### Features

* Shopping page for all products with images and product info
* Reminder and order notifications
* Past order page
* FAQ page for program and other health-related resources on campus
* Admin/order fulfillment side
